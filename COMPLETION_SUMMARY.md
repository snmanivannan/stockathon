## 🔍 Current Page Flow (Optimized)

```
1. Hero          ← Strong hook ("A Hackathon for Stocks")
2. Proof         ← Trust signals (weekly challenges, real prices)
3. Why           ← Problem/solution frame
4. Features      ← 6 key benefits
5. SCREENSHOT    ← VISUAL PROOF (new!) ⭐
6. Comparison    ← Why we're different
7. How It Works  ← Step-by-step process
8. FAQ           ← Address objections
